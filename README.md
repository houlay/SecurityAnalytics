Securities Analytics

Our app Securities Analytics is a browser based toolkit that allows the user to perform in depth analysis on stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies, and ETFs. The app achieves this by using Alpha Vantage API that provides extremely detailed historical data for the past 20 years and displays it in various informative graphs powered by d3.js. Our aim is to provide an investment tool that allows the user to easily digest complex information, realize market trends, and make a well informed investment decision. 

Possible additional features include an informative dashboard page that displays graphs that would provide the user with great barometrics on the current state of the US and global economy. This page would include the US trade deficit, market sentiment, employment rate, top currencies price index, and Federal Reserve interest rates. 

To use our app, the user would need to create an account that will save their favorites securities and number of positions held in each saved security. Once a particular security is selected, the user will be able to display that security’s historical price index in various informative graphs. Also if time permits, user will have access to an economic dashboard page that will provide domestic and global economy indicators to help give the user a “feel” for the current health of the market.
